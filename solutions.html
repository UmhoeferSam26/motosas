        <h2 class="section-title">Brand Awareness for All Businesses</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
            Every Motosas pouch is an opportunity to reinforce your brand while providing genuine value to your customers.
            By giving branded Faraday pouches to customers, you demonstrate commitment to their safety and security.
        </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    When customers receive a high-quality Faraday pouch bearing your company logo, they see tangible evidence
                    of your commitment to their wellbeing. This physical reminder sits in their home, reinforcing your brand
                    every time they secure their car keys.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    Unlike digital communications that can be ignored or forgotten, a branded Faraday pouch provides lasting
                    value that customers will use daily. This creates positive brand associations and strengthens customer loyalty.

                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    Branded Faraday pouches offer exceptional return on marketing investment. They serve both a practical
                    security function and a continuous brand presence in customers' homes and vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're a small local business or a national chain, customised Faraday pouches can be produced
                    at scale with your branding, colours, and messaging. They work as welcome gifts, loyalty rewards, or
                    value-added items that differentiate your service.

        <p class="section-subtitle">
            Motosas has developed targeted solutions for key automotive and insurance sectors,
            each designed around specific operational requirements and customer touchpoints.

                <h4>Automotive Leasing</h4>
                <h3>Car Leasing Companies</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    Leasing companies face unique challenges with keyless vehicle security. Your customers drive high-value
                    vehicles that are prime targets for relay attacks, yet they may not feel the same ownership responsibility
                    as traditional car buyers.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    <strong>Our Solution:</strong> Include a branded Faraday pouch with every lease agreement. This demonstrates
                    your commitment to asset protection while educating customers about relay attack risks. The pouch can include
                    your emergency contact details and security guidelines specific to the leased vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduce theft claims, demonstrate duty of care, enhance customer onboarding experience,
                    and provide a physical brand presence throughout the lease period.
                </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h4>Insurance Industry</h4>
                <h3>Insurance Companies</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    Motor insurers are increasingly concerned about keyless car theft claims. Offering Faraday pouches
                    demonstrates proactive risk management and can form part of your underwriting strategy for keyless vehicles.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    <strong>Our Solution:</strong> Distribute branded Faraday pouches to policyholders with keyless entry vehicles,
                    particularly in high-risk postcodes. Include QR codes linking to your claims portal or security advice pages.
                    This can be offered as a policy benefit or incentive for higher-value vehicle covers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduce theft claim frequency, demonstrate loss prevention leadership, differentiate
                    policy offerings, and provide documentation of reasonable risk mitigation for underwriting purposes.

                <h4>Rental Services</h4>
                <h3>Car Rental Companies</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    Rental companies manage large fleets of high-value keyless vehicles that are constantly changing hands.
                    Relay attacks can occur during rental periods or when vehicles are parked at rental locations.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    <strong>Our Solution:</strong> Provide Faraday pouches with each rental, included in the handover pack.
                    Clear instructions educate temporary users about relay attacks and proper key storage. The pouch can include
                    your 24-hour contact number and vehicle return information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Protect fleet assets, reduce insurance premiums through demonstrated security measures,
                    educate customers about vehicle security, and provide peace of mind during rental periods.

                <h3>Second-Hand Dealerships</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    Second-hand dealerships selling keyless vehicles can use Faraday pouches as a value-added differentiator.
                    Many used car buyers may be unaware of relay attack risks associated with their new purchase.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0.9rem;">
                    <strong>Our Solution:</strong> Include a branded Faraday pouch with every keyless vehicle sale as part of
                    your handover pack. This demonstrates your commitment to customer safety and adds perceived value to the
                    purchase. The pouch can include your warranty information and service contact details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Enhance customer satisfaction, differentiate from competitors, demonstrate
                    professional standards, create lasting brand presence, and provide an additional sales talking point.
